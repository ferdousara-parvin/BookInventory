# BookInventory

For this assignment, we had to create a Book class which possessed 4 attributes (price, author, ISB, and title). 
We then implemented this class in the driver class called Assignment1 (which simulated a book store) to keep track of the books. 
We were able to add new Books to the "store", change information of a book, display all books by a specific author and display all books under a certain price <br>
